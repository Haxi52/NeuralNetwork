# Neural Network From Scratch

This project is a simple implementation of a neural network from scratch using only C#, no external libraries. 
The goal of this project is to understand the inner workings of a neural network and to be able to implement one from scratch.


## Getting Started

Run the Visualizer project and click the "Learn" button to see the neural network in action. 
A visualization will show the network's progress in learning to draw a sine wave.
